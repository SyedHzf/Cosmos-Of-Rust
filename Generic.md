# Generic Data Types;
We can use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types.
### In Function;
Generics makes our code more flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.

__For Example:__
Making two largest() named fuctions one will return largest number and other will largest char from a list.
```rs 
    // Largest_number.
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
```
---
```rs
    // Largest_char.
fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> char {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
} 
```
---


```rs
    // Calling both Fuctions in Main method.
fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
    assert_eq!(result, 100);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
    assert_eq!(result, 'y');
}

```
This is a long way code with same concept, we can reduce it using Generic data type;
```rs
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

There is an error in above code which i have solved in last heading(Practice).
### In Struct;
We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields using the <> syntax.

```rs
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```
In the above code it is neccesary that both (x & y) will be of same type. otherwise error occured.
```rs
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```
But in this code both(x & y) can be of same or different types.
### In Enum;
we can define enums to hold generic data types in their variants.
```rs

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
    }
```

--- 
OR
```rs

#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
    }
}
```

### In Method ;
We can implement methods on structs and enums and use generic types in their definitions.
```rs
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```
---

```rs
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

impl<T, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mixup<V, W>(self, other: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```
## Beauty Of Rust;
You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when you’re using generic type parameters. The good news is that Rust implements generics in such a way that your code doesn’t run any slower using generic types than it would with concrete types.

Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code that is using generics at compile time. Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.
### Practice;
Below code will give an compile time error.
```rs
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
Because in this code,compiler detect their is a variable of type `T` whose has tobe of compareable time in code block , therefore not all data types are compareable.
to solve this we have to declare the characteristics of data types which will be use in the function.

```rs
fn largest<T : PartialOrd + Copy>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for &item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```
