# Modules:
Modules let us organize code within a crate into groups for readability and easy reuse. Modules also control the privacy of items, which is whether an item can be used by outside code (public) or is an internal implementation detail and not available for outside use (private).

    mod front_of_house {
        /-  // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(); -/
        mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist() {}

            fn seat_at_table() {}
        }

        mod serving {
            fn take_order() {}

            fn serve_order() {}

            fn take_payment() {}
        }
    }
